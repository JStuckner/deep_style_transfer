#### Acknowledgements
The style transfer code comes from [this repo](https://github.com/ryanwongsa/Real-time-multi-style-transfer). <br>
The original paper is [A LEARNED REPRESENTATION FOR ARTISTIC STYLE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07629.pdf) (Vincent Dumoulin & Jonathon Shlens & Manjunath Kudlur).

#### My contribution
1. Developed code to analyze audio using the librosa library
2. Used the audio to control the style.
3. Created code to webscrape Chillhop music (The music is fair use and available for download. It was just tedious.)
